# sudoku

## Overview

A Sudoku game built with the Python Tkinter module. Allows you to create custom Sudoku puzzles, and then solve them. Includes some default puzzles to get you started and a solver in case you get stuck!

## Features

- Solve the included Sudoku puzzles with a graphical interface
- Create your own custom Sudoku puzzles as plain text files, and save them so you can solve them (or have them solved for you!)
  - Validate the puzzles you create using the solver - if it does not find a solution, then your puzzle is invalid!
- Reset your work with the "Reset" button
- If you get stuck, have the computer solve the Sudoku for you with the "Solve" button
- Coming soon: Have the computer provide a hint by filling in one square for you

## Usage Notes
